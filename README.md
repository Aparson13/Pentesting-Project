# Final-Project
## Background Information
This is my final project for my University of Richmond Cyber Security Bootcamp. This final project was a Pentesting simulation. I mapped the topology of the network using nmap scan. From there, I was able to tell the vulnerabilities of the system. I then exploited said vulnerabilities and discussed how I avoided detection in doing the exploitations. 

## Tools used
- Azure Cloud Lab Services
- Nmap
- Kali Linux
